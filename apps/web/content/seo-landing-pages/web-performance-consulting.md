## Problem Group

**problemTitle**:
The True Cost of Poor Performance

**painPoints** (add each as an item):

1. Title: Core Web Vitals Are Red
   Description: Google Search Console is showing failing CWV scores. LCP is over 4 seconds, CLS is causing layout shifts, and FID/INP is sluggish. Your SEO rankings are suffering.

2. Title: Users Are Bouncing
   Description: Analytics show users leaving before the page fully loads. Mobile users on slower connections have an especially poor experience. Conversion rates are below industry benchmarks.

3. Title: Bundle Size Keeps Growing
   Description: Every new feature adds more JavaScript. Your bundle analyzer looks like a rainbow of large dependencies. Code splitting exists but isn't strategic.

4. Title: Performance Regressions Slip Through
   Description: You fix one performance issue, and two more appear. There's no systematic way to catch regressions before they hit production. Performance is an afterthought.

## FAQ Group

**faqTitle**:
Frequently Asked Questions

**faqs** (add each as an item):

1. Question: How do you measure success?
   Answer: Real user metrics are the gold standard. We track Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, INP), Time to Interactive, and custom metrics relevant to your business goals.

2. Question: What if my site uses a framework other than React/Next.js?
   Answer: Performance principles apply across frameworks. While React/Next.js is my specialty, I've optimized Vue, Angular, and vanilla JS applications.

3. Question: How long until we see results?
   Answer: Quick wins often show impact within days. Core Web Vitals changes take a few weeks to reflect in Google Search Console as Google re-crawls your pages.

4. Question: Do you guarantee specific Lighthouse scores?
   Answer: I focus on real user metrics, not Lighthouse scores. A 100 Lighthouse score with poor real-world performance isn't useful. We'll target metrics that matter.

5. Question: Can you help with mobile performance specifically?
   Answer: Absolutely. Mobile is often where performance problems are most acute. I test across device types and connection speeds to ensure improvements help all users.
