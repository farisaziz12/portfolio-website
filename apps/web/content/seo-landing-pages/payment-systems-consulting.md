## Problem Group

**problemTitle**:
Payment Integration Is Harder Than It Looks

**painPoints** (add each as an item):

1. Title: Checkout Abandonment Is Killing Revenue
   Description: Your checkout flow has friction. Users drop off at payment. Error messages are confusing. You're leaving money on the table but don't know exactly where.

2. Title: Subscription Logic Is a Mess
   Description: Proration, upgrades, downgrades, cancellations, dunning—subscription billing has infinite edge cases. Your current implementation handles the happy path but breaks on everything else.

3. Title: You're Nervous About Payment Code
   Description: Nobody wants to touch the payment code. It works (mostly), but it's held together with duct tape. Refunds are manual. Webhooks sometimes fail silently. Testing is... aspirational.

4. Title: Compliance and Security Concerns
   Description: PCI compliance, Strong Customer Authentication (SCA), tax calculation—the regulatory landscape is complex. You need payment infrastructure that handles compliance without constant manual intervention.

## FAQ Group

**faqTitle**:
Frequently Asked Questions

**faqs** (add each as an item):

1. Question: Do you only work with Stripe?
   Answer: Stripe is my specialty, but I also have experience with payment orchestration platforms and can advise on multi-provider strategies. If you're evaluating payment providers, I can help with that decision.

2. Question: Can you help with PCI compliance?
   Answer: I help teams implement Stripe in PCI-compliant ways (using Stripe Elements, Checkout, etc.). For formal PCI audits, you'll need a QSA, but I can ensure your implementation follows best practices.

3. Question: What about payment fraud?
   Answer: I help implement Stripe Radar rules and design systems that balance fraud prevention with customer experience. For high-risk businesses, I can advise on additional fraud prevention strategies.

4. Question: Do you work with marketplace/platform payments?
   Answer: Yes. Stripe Connect (Standard, Express, Custom) is complex territory. I've helped platforms design payout systems, handle KYC flows, and manage multi-party transactions.

5. Question: How long does a typical payment integration take?
   Answer: It depends on complexity. A straightforward checkout can be done in days. Subscription billing with all edge cases might take weeks. We'll scope it properly in our discovery call.
