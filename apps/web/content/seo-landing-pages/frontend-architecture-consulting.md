Frontend Architecture That Scales

**heroHeadline**:
Build Frontend Systems That 50 Engineers Can Work On Without Stepping On Each Other's Toes

**heroSubheadline**:
Good architecture is invisible when it works. Bad architecture creates merge conflicts, inconsistent UIs, and developers who dread touching shared code. I help teams design frontend systems that enable speed without sacrificing quality.

## Problem Group

**problemTitle**:
The Challenges of Scaling Frontend Teams

**painPoints** (add each as an item):

1. Title: Component Chaos
   Description: You have 3 different button components, 5 modal implementations, and nobody's sure which one to use. The "component library" is really just a folder of components with varying quality.

2. Title: Monorepo Growing Pains
   Description: Your monorepo started simple but now CI takes 45 minutes, dependencies are tangled, and changes in one package break things elsewhere. Teams are afraid to refactor.

3. Title: Inconsistent Patterns Across Teams
   Description: Team A uses Redux, Team B uses Zustand, Team C rolled their own. Data fetching is different everywhere. Onboarding new developers takes months because there's no "standard way."

4. Title: Design-Dev Handoff Is Broken
   Description: Designers create components in Figma that don't match what's in code. Developers rebuild the same components slightly differently each time. The UI is death by a thousand paper cuts.

## Expertise Group

**expertiseTitle**:
Architecture Challenges I Solve

**expertiseAreas** (add each as an item):

1. Title: Design System Architecture
   Description: Build component libraries that designers and developers actually use. Token-based theming, accessible by default, documented with Storybook, and integrated with your design tools.
   Icon: 🎨

2. Title: Monorepo Strategy
   Description: Design monorepo structures that scale. Package boundaries, dependency management, selective CI/CD, and tooling (Turborepo, Nx, or alternatives) that keeps builds fast.
   Icon: 📦

3. Title: State Management Architecture
   Description: Cut through the state management confusion. Define clear patterns for server state vs. client state, choose the right tools, and establish conventions your whole team follows.
   Icon: 🎯

4. Title: Micro-Frontend Architecture
   Description: When (and when not) to use micro-frontends. Module federation, runtime integration, shared dependencies—I help teams navigate this complex space.
   Icon: 🧩

5. Title: API Layer Design
   Description: Structure your frontend's data layer. API clients, caching strategies, optimistic updates, and error handling patterns that make data fetching predictable.
   Icon: 🔗

6. Title: Testing Architecture
   Description: Design a testing strategy that catches bugs without slowing down development. Unit, integration, and E2E test boundaries. What to mock, what to test for real.
   Icon: 🧪

## FAQ Group

**faqTitle**:
Frequently Asked Questions

**faqs** (add each as an item):

1. Question: Do you help with implementation or just planning?
   Answer: Both. I can provide architecture guidance and let your team implement, or I can work alongside your team during implementation. We'll find the right balance.

2. Question: How long does an architecture assessment take?
   Answer: Typically 1-2 weeks from kickoff to final report, depending on codebase complexity and team availability for interviews.

3. Question: We're a small team—do we need architecture consulting?
   Answer: Small teams often benefit most from getting architecture right early. It's much easier to set good patterns with 5 engineers than to fix them with 50.

4. Question: What technologies do you work with?
   Answer: Primarily React/Next.js ecosystems, but architectural principles apply broadly. I've worked with Vue, Angular, and framework-agnostic systems as well.

5. Question: Can you help us choose between X and Y?
   Answer: Yes. Whether it's monorepo tools, state management libraries, or design system approaches, I help teams make informed decisions based on their specific needs.
