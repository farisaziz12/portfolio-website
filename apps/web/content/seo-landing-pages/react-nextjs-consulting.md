## Problem Group

**problemTitle**:
React Apps That Start Fast Don't Always Stay Fast

**painPoints** (add each as an item):

1. Title: Architecture Debt Accumulates
   Description: Your app started simple, but now component trees are 15 levels deep, state management is scattered across 4 different solutions, and nobody wants to touch the checkout flow.

2. Title: Performance Degrades Over Time
   Description: Bundle sizes keep growing. Core Web Vitals are slipping. Users on slower connections are bouncing. Your team knows there's a problem but isn't sure where to start.

3. Title: Server Components Confusion
   Description: Next.js 14+ promises better performance with Server Components, but the mental model shift is challenging. Your team is mixing client and server code incorrectly, and builds are failing.

4. Title: Team Knowledge Gaps
   Description: Senior developers have their patterns, juniors have different ones. Code reviews catch inconsistencies, but there's no shared understanding of "the right way" for your specific needs.

## FAQ Group

**faqTitle**:
Frequently Asked Questions

**faqs** (add each as an item):

1. Question: Do you write code or just advise?
   Answer: Both. I can provide strategic advice and architecture guidance, or roll up my sleeves and pair program with your team on implementation. We'll determine the right mix based on your needs.

2. Question: What if we're not using Next.js?
   Answer: No problem. While Next.js is my specialty, I work with teams using Vite, Remix, or plain React (CRA migrations, etc.). The architectural principles apply across React frameworks.

3. Question: How do you handle remote work?
   Answer: I'm based in Switzerland and work with teams globally. All consulting is remote-friendly with video calls, screen sharing, and async communication via Slack or your preferred tool.

4. Question: What's your availability?
   Answer: I typically book 2-4 weeks out for new engagements. For ongoing advisory relationships, we establish a regular cadence that works for both sides.

5. Question: Do you sign NDAs?
   Answer: Yes, happy to sign reasonable NDAs before diving into your codebase.
