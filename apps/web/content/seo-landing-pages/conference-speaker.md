## Problem Group

**problemTitle**:
Finding the Right Speaker Matters

**painPoints** (add each as an item):

1. Title: Generic Talks Don't Resonate
   Description: Attendees can spot a speaker who hasn't done the real work. They want insights from someone who's built production systems, not just read about them.

2. Title: Engagement Drops After 10 Minutes
   Description: Death by slides kills conferences. You need speakers who can hold attention, mix theory with live demos, and make complex topics accessible.

3. Title: No Actionable Takeaways
   Description: Inspiration is nice, but attendees want to leave with concrete things they can apply Monday morning. Abstract talks don't move the needle.

4. Title: Last-Minute Cancellations
   Description: You need reliable speakers who prepare thoroughly, communicate clearly, and show up ready to deliver—even when things go wrong.
