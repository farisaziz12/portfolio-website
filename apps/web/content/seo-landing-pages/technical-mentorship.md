2. Title: Imposter Syndrome Won't Quit
   Description: You wonder if you're good enough, if you belong in the room, if someone's going to figure out you don't know everything. It's exhausting.

3. Title: No One to Ask the Real Questions

4. Title: Career Decisions Feel High Stakes
   Description: Should you take that new job? Ask for a raise? Switch to management? Move to a different tech stack? These decisions feel huge, and you're not sure who to trust for guidance.

## FAQ Group

**faqTitle**:
Frequently Asked Questions

**faqs** (add each as an item):

1. Question: How long do mentorship relationships typically last?
   Answer: Most people work with me for 3-6 months, though some continue longer. We'll check in regularly on whether the relationship is still valuable.

2. Question: What if I'm not sure what I need help with?
   Answer: That's fine! We'll figure it out together. Many mentees start with a vague sense of "I want to grow" and we clarify specific goals in our first few sessions.

3. Question: How is this different from coaching?
   Answer: I'm a mentor, not a coach. I share my experience and perspective, give advice when asked, and sometimes just tell you what I'd do. Coaches tend to ask questions to help you find your own answers—I do that too, but I'm also happy to be more directive.

4. Question: Can you help with technical interview prep?
   Answer: Yes, especially for frontend/React roles. We can do mock interviews, review your approach to system design questions, and work on how you communicate your thinking.

5. Question: Is this only for React developers?
   Answer: Most of my mentees work in React/frontend, but career growth topics apply broadly. If you're a backend or full-stack engineer, we can still work together on career strategy, leadership, and communication.
